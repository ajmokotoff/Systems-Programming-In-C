# Structs, Arrays, and Pointers

In this project, I implemented Strings and implement my own String functions to mimic C's built in functions.

Program Description:
My program contains: makefile for compiling, ctest.c which is the runner, mystring.c which contains my functions, and mystring.h which contains the function prototypes for mystring.c. In this program I made functions that mimics C's built in character array (string) functions. These functions contain: strdup, strlen, strcpy, strcat, strncat, strncpy, and strndup. Each function has a "my" in front of it and are all located in mystring.c. In ctest.c I test all the functions, while also showing C's function, to show that they are infact the same.


Instructions:
Due to my makefile, simply type "make" into terminal. Your code is now compiled. Then to run the file, type "./ctest". Once finished, it is good practice to type "make clean" because if we change the contents of the program and the executables, it will not run correctly.
